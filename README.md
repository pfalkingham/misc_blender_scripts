# misc_blender_scripts
A collection of simple scripts for blender in my workflows


**exportVertexPos.py** - This script exports vertex positions for a mesh over the timeline. I.e. if the mesh deforms (or just moves), each vertex gets it's xyz position exported to a text file.  you then get 1 text file per frame.

**exportSTLsFlipBook.py** - exports selected mesh(s) at each frame, so if mesh is moving or deforming, you get a new stl for each frame in the timeline
