# misc_blender_scripts
A collection of simple scripts for blender in my workflows


exportVertexPos.py - This script exports vertex positions for a mesh over the timeline. I.e. if the mesh deforms (or just moves), each vertex gets it's xyz position exported to a text file.  you then get 1 text file per frame.
